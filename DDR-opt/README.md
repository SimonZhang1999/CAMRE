## Quick Start
Compiling tests passed on ubuntu **18.04, and 20.04** with ros installed.
You can just execute the following commands one by one.
### Dependence:
``` bash
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-tf2-sensor-msgs # noetic or melodic
```

OSQP and OSQP-Eigen make it easier to modify parameters and are used to solve control problems under velocity and angular velocity control.
You can download them from the following two links:
- Download [osqp-v0.6.3-src.tar.gz](https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/tag/v0.6.3) or click [here](https://github.com/osqp/osqp/releases/download/v0.6.3/osqp-v0.6.3-src.tar.gz), and then follow the [installation instructions](https://osqp.org/docs/get_started/sources.html)
- Download [OSQP-eigen v0.8.1](https://github.com/robotology/osqp-eigen/releases/tag/v0.8.1).
```bash
cd osqp-eigen
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ../
make
sudo make install
```

**NOTE:** We may have forgotten other dependencies 😟, sorry! If you could provide missing dependencies, we would greatly appreciate it. 

### Build
``` bash
mkdir -p DDRopt_ws/src
cd DDRopt_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ZJU-FAST-Lab/DDR-opt.git
cd ..
catkin build
```

### Run
You can run any of the following: 
``` bash
roslaunch plan_manager planner_nmpc.launch # for robots controlled by wheel speeds
roslaunch plan_manager planner_sim_unknown.launch # for planning in unknown space
roslaunch plan_manager planner_sim.launch # for robots controlled by linear and angular velocity
```

You can use `2D Nav Goal` to set goal point.  

## Update
25-12-02
1. Fixed the bug reported in [Issue 16](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/DDR-opt/issues/16). Thanks to JMang0321 for the report!


25-07-25  
1. Enhanced the 'if_directly_constrain_v_omega' feature. Users can now select between: 1) Constraining linear (v) and angular (omega) velocities independently, or 2) Constraining the product (v * omega) considering wheel speed limits.
2. Reduced the number of ROS messages in the code that do not use topic remapping. 
3. Fixed the bug reported in [Issue 11](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/DDR-opt/issues/11). Thanks to SCUTBob for the report!
